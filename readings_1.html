        Week One: "In Plato's Cave" by Susan Sontag

        The evolution of photography has played a significant role in recording and preserving the experiences of humankind. Not only is photography known as a creative hobby, it is an influential tool that fundamentally alters our understanding of our history. According to Susan Sontag in her essay “In Plato’s Cave”, she discusses the importance of photography, and how we essentially “collect the world” with the photos that we take. In the beginning of the text, Sontag mentions how “humankind lingers unregeneratively in Plato’s cave, still reveling, its age-old habit, in mere images of the truth.”. In regards to this quote, Sontag discusses how these “mere images” calm the human soul more than the harshness of the truth. Personally, I am fascinated by this particular analysis, and I concur with the thought that photography has shaped our perspectives and relations with the real world. This turns humanity into collectors of a distant world that differs from our true reality.

        Throughout the text, Sontag highlights the significance of photography and its vast variety of purposes it holds. As an example: tourism, documentation, artistic expression – the versatility of photography remains undeniable. People take photos for multiple reasons, whether it be to commemorate an important event, document a specific detail, et cetera. Despite the innocent reasons for photography, Sontag discusses how there are negative impacts as well. She mentions how the camera can be compared to a weapon, more specifically a gun, where photography can be utilized to harm others. In the essay, Sontag states the following: “To photograph people is to violate them, by seeing them as they never see themselves, by having knowledge of them they can never have; it turns people into objects that can be symbolically possessed. Just as the camera is a sublimation of the gun, to photograph someone is a sublimated murder – a soft murder, appropriate to a sad, frightened time.” This particular metaphor of the camera reveals how humanity treats photographs; rather than experiencing reality firsthand, these photographs of others remain as an object of their collection. Sontag hints at the fact that we reduce living people into “objects” and keep photos as frozen moments that photographers keep and control. To further add onto this claim, Sontag refers to the movie Peeping Tom (1960) by Michael Powell as an example. In this film, a psychopath is the protagonist who kills women while using his camera as a form of a weapon. He photographs his victims without touching them, utilizing his photography skills as a form of cruelty and collecting the images for his own wicked fantasies. As mentioned in the essay, Sontag states how “he doesn’t desire their bodies; he wants their presence in the form of filmed images – those showing them experiencing their own death – which he screens at home for his solitary pleasure”. Similar to the protagonist in the movie, humanity often uses the camera as a tool to “cover up” the messy and cruel reality, disguising it with a false yet controllable image. By prioritizing the “picture perfect moment” over the actual subject of the photograph, humans maintain a “distance” between reality and a false portrayal. .

        Ultimately, Sontag’s essay delves into the paradox that photography remains a tool of aggression and repression, as much as it is a creative one. In a society where photography is extremely normalized and essentially overused, humanity may lose itself in a false reality of its own images.
