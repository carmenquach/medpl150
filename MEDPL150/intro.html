            </h3>
            <p> 
                Ever since I was young, I have always been fascinated by creative technology and its ability to bring any ideas to life. Whether it's through digital art, video editing, or interactive media, I find joy in exploring new ways to express myself and connect others. My passion for creativity drives me to constantly learn and experiment with multiple forms of media and techniques.
