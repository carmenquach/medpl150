            In order from left to right, the first image is an example of using artificial zoom to create a close-up of the subject. 
            <br><br>
            The second image is an example of using a shallow depth of field to create a blurry background and make the subject more focused. 
            <br> <b>f/5.6, ISO 400</b> <br><br>
            The third image is an example of using a deep depth of field to have everything in focus, including the background. 
            <br> <b>f/10, ISO 1600</b> <br><br>
            The fourth image is meant for comparisons, it is the original raw photo that I took at the computer lab.
